Open Terminal
Created Github Account
We created repo in Github
We copied the repo git and ran git clone
Downloaded XCode for git tools
Then git cloned
Then downloaded Visual Studio code
Install code in path
We are readme
git statused, git added, we git commited with a message
We edit our global git with vi
got on password
we generated ssh
and got the copy from bad github documentation
We got the ssh url for github
But we had to reset origin to ssh code repo (crazy)
